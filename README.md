# php-anonymizer


Php panonymizer reads all php files classes and remove all php code and commentaries. It creates empty classes with empty methods.
This is useful when a part of the code is not your property and you are not allowed to read it but the other part of the code depends on it.
This anonymizer do not asure the code will work, but it will facilitate you to create a factice module to simulate the code you don't have access.
